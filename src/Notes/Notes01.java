	 * A regular class can extends a regular class or an abstract class can also
	 * implements more than one interfaces when implementing interfaces it will pull
	 * method from the child class
	 * 
	 * Abstract class can extends
	 * 
	 * abstract method can non static method and regular method
	 * 
	 * Interface is Interface use extends to inherit more interface
	 * 
	 * an interface is a collection of method which is declared in nature
	 * 
	 * from java 1.8 java implemented static and default type
	 * 
	 * if a method is static, no help is needed from object to print out
	 * 
	 * Interface cannot be instantiated? because implementation is not complete It
	 * needs to be replaces with a concrete class
	 * 
	 * as long as the concrete class implements interfaces they can be called
	 * 
	 * An abstract cannot be instantiated because implementation is not complete
	 * 
	 * can a constructor of an abstract class be initialized yes only when abstract
	 * class is instantiated by concrete class
	 * 
	 * Static method can be called by the Interface itself The font will be changed
	 * to italic when static method is called using object
	 * 
	 * what's the other way to instantiate an interface with out implementing a
	 * class? By an anonymous inner class
	 * 
	 * Final type of method can be overloaded 
	 * Static method can be overloaded
	 * Class directly calls the static method
	 * 
	 * 
	 * final type method cannot be overridden because it is a final method
	 * static method cannot be override
